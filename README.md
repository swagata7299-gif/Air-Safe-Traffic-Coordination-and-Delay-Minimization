# Air-Safe-Traffic-Coordination-and-Delay-Minimization
This project tackles the ongoing challenges of air traffic delays, which have significant effects on aviation efficiency, customer satisfaction, and operational costs. It proposes an integrated system that combines several advanced techniques, including optimization algorithms, pathfinding methods, real-time data analysis, and predictive modeling, to optimize air traffic management. Optimization algorithms like Dynamic Programming (DP) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are employed to improve resource allocation, scheduling, and minimize delays in flight operations. Pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra and A* are used to identify the most efficient routes for flights, considering factors like congestion and weather conditions. The use of real-time data ensures the system can adapt dynamically to changing circumstances, enhancing decision-making in real-time. Additionally, a predictive model is developed to forecast potential delays based on historical data, helping airlines proactively manage disruptions. By combining these approaches, the system aims to optimize flight schedules, reduce delays, and enhance the overall efficiency of air traffic management, improving the passenger experience and reducing costs for airlines and airports.
